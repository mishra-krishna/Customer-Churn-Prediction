# Telco Customer Churn Prediction

Predicting customer churn for a telecom company using machine learning algorithms.

## Overview

This project aims to analyze telecom customer data and predict churn using two popular machine learning algorithms: XGBoost and AdaBoost.

## Project Files

- **churn_prediction_xgboost.py**: Script for data preprocessing, feature selection, and XGBoost model training.
- **churn_prediction_adaboost.py**: Script for data preprocessing, feature selection, and AdaBoost model training.

## Features

- Data preprocessing includes encoding categorical variables and handling missing values.
- Feature selection using SelectKBest to identify top features for prediction.
- Model training and hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV.
- Model evaluation using cross-validation and accuracy scores.
- Confusion matrix visualization for model performance.
